> This contribution introduces Elastic Component Regression (ECR) as an explorative data analysis method that utilizes a tuning parameter to supervise the **X**-matrix decomposition. It is demonstrated theoretically that the elastic component resulting from ECR coincides with principal components of PCA when α=0 and also coincides with PLS components when α=1. In this context, PCR and PLS occupy the two ends of ECR and will lead to an infinite number of transitional models which collectively uncovers the model path from PCR to PLS. Therefore, the framework of ECR shows a natural progression from PCR to PLS and may help add some insight into their relationships in theory. The performance of ECR is investigated on a series of simulated datasets together with a real world near infrared dataset. The following figure gives a path from PCR to PLS on a NIR dataset. The **green line** refers to the path computed by ECR, whereas the red one is derived using the CR algorithm.
